PyStemmusScope documentation
****************************

Welcome to the documentation of PyStemmusScope, a python package that enables researchers
to use the MATLAB-based STEMMUS-SCOPE model.

`STEMMUS-SCOPE <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/1379/2021/>`_ is an integrated
soil-plant-atmosphere continuum model based on the models
`SCOPE <https://github.com/Christiaanvandertol/SCOPE/>`_ and
`STEMMUS <https://blog.utwente.nl/stemmus/introduction/>`_, and models
canopy photosynthesis, fluorescence, and the transfer of energy, mass, and momentum.

For a guide on how to setup and run the model, see the :doc:`user guide <readme_link>`.
If you are interested in contributing to the PyStemmusScope code, see the
:doc:`contributing guide <contributing_link>`.
