Climate extremes like droughts and heatwaves impact how water, energy, and
carbon move through ecosystems. To capture the exchange between the land surface
and the atmosphere, we aim to apply the “STEMMUS-SCOPE” model across ecosystems
at a global scale. The model STEMMUS simulates soil water and heat, and the
model SCOPE the vegetation photosynthesis and land surface energy balance.

Like other land surface models, STEMMUS-SCOPE relies on a large number of
numerical calculations using various meteorological data and surface parameters
as inputs. To overcome challenges such as computational costs and optimization
issues in calibration, we developed open-source tools for efficient computing
and data handling following FAIR guidelines within the context of EcoExtreML
project. In this project, we improved the representation of
soil-water-plant-energy interaction in the model, developed a machine learning
approach to emulate the model, and enhanced the re-usability of the model using
the Basic Model Interface (BMI).

The technologies developed in EcoExtreML will
contribute to developing a digital twin of soil-plant systems.
